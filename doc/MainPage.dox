/** @mainpage

%Magnum is 3D graphics engine written in C++11 and OpenGL 3 Core Profile.
Features:

- Easy-to-use templated @ref Math "mathematical library" for matrix/vector
  calculations.
- Comprehensive use of C++11 features for safety, performance and ease of
  development.
- Hierarchical @ref Scene "scene graph" which supports transformation caching
  for better performance, classes for convenient usage of
  @ref AbstractShaderProgram "shaders", @ref Buffer "buffers" and
  @ref Texture "textures".
- @ref MeshTools "Mesh tools" for cleaning, optimizing and generating meshes.
  Collection of pre-made @ref Primitives "graphic primitives" and
  @ref Shaders "shaders" for testing purposes.

The engine is meant to be run on OpenGL 3 capable hardware, but most of the
functionality is working on OpenGL 2.1 hardware too. See also
@ref RequiredExtensions.

@section BasicUsage Basic usage

%Scene in %Magnum is composed of hierarchically connected object instances.
To build the scene, you need Scene object with assigned Camera and some Object
instances. When rendering using Camera::draw(), the engine goes through all
objects connected to camera scene and calls Object::draw() on them.

All objects are by default empty. To make object renderable in the scene,
you must reimplement Object::draw(), and for example bind an
@ref AbstractShaderProgram "shader", @ref Texture "texture" and
render an prepared @ref Mesh "mesh".
