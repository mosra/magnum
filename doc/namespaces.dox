@brief Root namespace

Contains classes for interacting with OpenGL.

This library is built as part of Magnum by default. To use this library with
CMake, you need to find the `Magnum` package and link to the `Magnum::Magnum`
target:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(Magnum REQUIRED)

# ...
target_link_libraries(your-app Magnum::Magnum)

/** @namespace Magnum::Platform
@brief Platform-specific application and context creation

Base classes for creating applications with various toolkits.

Parts of this namespace are built if `WITH_*APPLICATION` is enabled when
building Magnum, with each library having specific toolkit dependencies and
platform requirements. To use a particular application library with CMake, you
need to request given `*Application` component of the `Magnum` package and link
to the `Magnum::Application` target. Example using the @ref Platform::Sdl2Application
library:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(Magnum REQUIRED Sdl2Application)

# ...
target_link_libraries(your-app Magnum::Application)
@endcode

See documentation of particular `*Application` classs, the
@ref magnum-gl-info "magnum-gl-info" utility documentation, @ref building,
@ref cmake and @ref platform for more information.
