The best way to get started is to read the thorough
@ref getting-started "guide to download, build, install and start using Magnum"
in your project. There is also a complete @ref building documentation --- we
provide packages for many platforms, including Windows, Linux and macOS. After
that, there are various @ref example-index "tutorials and examples" and a
complete @ref features "feature guide" explaining all aspects of the library.

Apart from that, various Magnum functionality is available through
@ref singles "single-header libraries". Just download a file, @cpp #include @ce
it in your project and you're ready to go! No buildsystem wrangling needed.
