@brief List of OpenGL driver workarounds used by Magnum

@m_footernavigation

Driver workarounds used by a particular app are listed in the engine startup
log such as here:

@code{.shell-session}
Renderer: GeForce GT 740M/PCIe/SSE2 by NVIDIA Corporation
OpenGL version: 4.6.0 NVIDIA 390.25
Using optional features:
    GL_ARB_ES2_compatibility
    GL_ARB_direct_state_access
    ...
Using driver workarounds:
    no-forward-compatible-core-context
    no-layout-qualifiers-on-old-glsl
    nv-zero-context-profile-mask
    ...
@endcode

These identifiers correspond to the strings in the listing below. For debugging
and diagnostic purposes it's possible to disable particular workarounds by
passing their identifier string to the `--magnum-disable-workarounds`
command-line option. See @ref GL-Context-usage-command-line for more information.
