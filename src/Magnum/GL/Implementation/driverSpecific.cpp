/* Calling glBufferData(), glMapBuffer(), glMapBufferRange() or glUnmapBuffer()
   on ANY buffer when ANY buffer is attached to a currently bound
   GL_TEXTURE_BUFFER crashes in gleUpdateCtxDirtyStateForBufStampChange deep
   inside Apple's GLengine. This can be worked around by unbinding all buffer
   textures before attempting to do such operation.

   A previous iteration of this workaround was to remember if a buffer is
   attached to a buffer texture, temporarily detaching it, calling given
   data-modifying API and then attaching it back with the same parameters.
   Unfortunately we also had to cache the internal texture format, as
   GL_TEXTURE_INTERNAL_FORMAT query is broken for buffer textures as well,
   returning always GL_R8 (the spec-mandated default). "Fortunately" macOS
   doesn't support ARB_texture_buffer_range so we didn't need to store also
   offset/size, only texture ID and its internal format, wasting 8 bytes per
   Buffer instance. HOWEVER, then we discovered this is not enough and also
   completely unrelated buffers suffer from the same crash. Fixing that
   properly in a similar manner would mean going through all live buffer
   texture instances and temporarily detaching their buffer when doing *any*
   data modification on *any* buffer, which would have extreme perf
   implications. So FORTUNATELY unbinding the textures worked around this too,
   and is a much nicer workaround after all. */

   to a mesh right after or repeatedly. Calling glBindBuffer() right before or
   after the data upload fixes the issue. The above is reproducible with the
   2019.01 ImGui example, and used to be worked around in a more hopeful way.
   However, the reports about things going *bad* in heavier ImGui-based apps
   didn't stop with that and none of my tests were able to reproduce anything.
   Since I lost patience already, I'm disabling the DSA code paths for
   everything related to buffers. (Two weeks pass.) But wait! while that fixed
   all issues for *some* users, it made things completely broken elsewhere,
   causing an app to render just a clear color and nothing else. The cancer
   apparently spread further, so I'm disabling all VAO-related DSA code paths
   as well now. Workarounds listed separately, in case someone might want to
   dig further or experience the misery of only one of them being active.

   To save you time experimenting:

   - (Epilepsy warning!) With the former disabled and no matter whether the
     second is disabled or not, the ImGui example (or any other ImGui-based
     app, really), the screen will start flickering heavily under *some*
     circumstances. This is known since drivers 24 at least.
   - With the former enabled and the second disabled, you might either
     experience a total doom, where just the framebuffer clear color is
     visible, or your app is totally fine. This is reproducible with drivers 25
     or 26 at least. Note that modifying the code to enable this workaround on
     other drivers (AMD on Windows, e.g.) doesn't break anything, so it's not
     like the workaround would be incomplete with some code paths still relying
     on DSA that's not there. It's clearly Intel drivers fault.
   - With both enabled, things seem to be fine, and I hope it stays that way
     also for future driver updates. */
