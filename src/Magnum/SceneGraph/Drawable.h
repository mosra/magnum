/**
@brief Drawable

Adds drawing functionality to the object. Each Drawable is part of some
@ref DrawableGroup and the whole group can be drawn with particular camera
using @ref Camera::draw().

@section SceneGraph-Drawable-subclassing Subclassing

The class is used via subclassing and implementing the @ref draw() function.
The simplest option is to do it via single inheritance. Example drawable object
that draws a blue sphere:

@snippet MagnumSceneGraph-gl.cpp Drawable-usage

For brevity the class has its own shader and mesh instance and a hardcoded
light position, usually you'll have them stored in a central location, shared
by multiple objects, and pass only references around.

The @p transformationMatrix parameter in the @ref draw() function contains
transformation of the object (to which the drawable is attached) relative to
@p camera. The camera contains the projection matrix. Some shaders (like the
@ref Shaders::PhongGL used in the snippet) have separate functions for setting
transformation and projection matrix, but some (such as @ref Shaders::FlatGL)
have a single function to set composite transformation and projection matrix.
In that case you need to combine the two matrices manually like in the
following code. Some shaders might have additional requirements, see their
respective documentation for details.

@snippet MagnumSceneGraph-gl.cpp Drawable-usage-shader

@section SceneGraph-Drawable-usage Drawing the scene

There is no way to just draw all the drawables in the scene, you need to create
some drawable group and add the drawable objects to both the scene and the
group. You can also use @ref DrawableGroup::add() and
@ref DrawableGroup::remove() instead of passing the group in the constructor.
If you don't need to change any properties of the drawable later, you can just
"create and forget", the scene graph will take care of all memory management
from there, deleting the drawable when the object is attached to is deleted.

@snippet MagnumSceneGraph-gl.cpp Drawable-usage-instance

The last thing you need is a camera attached to some object (thus using its
transformation). With the camera and the drawable group you can perform drawing
in your @ref Platform::Sdl2Application::drawEvent() "drawEvent()"
implementation. See @ref Camera2D and @ref Camera3D documentation for more
information.

@snippet MagnumSceneGraph-gl.cpp Drawable-usage-camera

@section SceneGraph-Drawable-multiple-inheritance Using multiple inheritance

Besides single inheritance, it's also possible to derive your class from both
@ref Object and @ref Drawable. This for example allows you to directly access
object transformation and parent/child relationship from within the drawable
object.

@snippet MagnumSceneGraph-gl.cpp Drawable-usage-multiple-inheritance

The @ref draw() implementation is the same as in the above snippet. Note that,
in contrast to the single inheritance case, where the @ref Drawable constructor
got the holder @cpp object @ce, here we pass it @cpp *this @ce, because this
class is both the holder object and the drawable. Instantiating the drawable
object is then done in a single step:

@snippet MagnumSceneGraph-gl.cpp Drawable-usage-instance-multiple-inheritance

@section SceneGraph-Drawable-multiple-groups Using multiple drawable groups to improve performance

You can organize your drawables to multiple groups to minimize OpenGL state
changes --- for example put all objects using the same shader, the same light
setup etc into one group, then put all transparent into another and set common
parameters once for whole group instead of setting them again in each
@ref draw() implementation. Example:

@snippet MagnumSceneGraph-gl.cpp Drawable-multiple-groups

@section SceneGraph-Drawable-draw-order Custom draw order and object culling

By default all contents of a drawable group are drawn, in the order they were
added. In some cases you may want to draw them in a different order (for
example to have correctly sorted transparent objects) or draw just a subset
(for example to cull invisible objects away). That can be achieved using
@ref Camera::drawableTransformations() in combination with
@ref Camera::draw(const std::vector<std::pair<std::reference_wrapper<Drawable<dimensions, T>>, MatrixTypeFor<dimensions, T>>>&).
For example, to have the objects sorted back-to-front, apply @ref std::sort()
with a custom predicate on the drawable transformation list:

@snippet MagnumSceneGraph.cpp Drawable-draw-order

Another use case is object-level culling --- assuming each drawable instance
provides an *absolute* AABB, one can calculate the transformations, cull them
via e.g. @ref Math::Intersection::rangeFrustum() and then pass the filtered
vector to @ref Camera::draw(). To be clear, this approach depends on AABBs
provided as relative to world origin, the actual object transformations don't
get used in any way except being passed to the draw function:

@snippet MagnumSceneGraph.cpp Drawable-culling

@section SceneGraph-Drawable-explicit-specializations Explicit template specializations

The following specializations are explicitly compiled into @ref SceneGraph
library. For other specializations (e.g. using @ref Magnum::Double "Double"
type) you have to use @ref Drawable.hpp implementation file to avoid linker
errors. See also @ref compilation-speedup-hpp for more information.
