/**
@brief Animable

Adds animation feature to object. Each Animable is part of some
@ref AnimableGroup, which takes care of running the animations.

@note
    The Animable feature affects only a single object. In many cases you have
    animations affecting multiple objects in a scene. See the @ref Animation
    namespace and the @ref Animation::Player class in particular for an
    alternative API.

@section SceneGraph-Animable-usage Usage

First thing is to add @ref Animable feature to some object and implement
@ref animationStep(). You can do it conveniently using multiple inheritance
(see @ref scenegraph-features for introduction). Override @ref animationStep()
to implement your animation, the function provides both absolute animation
time and time delta. Example:

@snippet MagnumSceneGraph.cpp Animable-usage-definition

Similarly to @ref Drawable feature, there is no way to just animate all the
objects in the scene. You need to create animable group and use it to control
given set of animations. You can also use @ref AnimableGroup::add() and
@ref AnimableGroup::remove() instead of passing the group in the constructor.
The animation is initially in stopped state and without repeat, see
@ref setState(), @ref setRepeated() and @ref setRepeatCount() for more
information.

@snippet MagnumSceneGraph.cpp Animable-usage

Animation step is performed by calling @ref AnimableGroup::step() in your draw
event implementation. The function expects absolute time from relative to some
fixed point in the past and time delta (i.e. duration of the frame). You can
use @ref Timeline for that, see its documentation for more information.

@snippet MagnumSceneGraph-gl.cpp Animable-usage-timeline

@section SceneGraph-Animable-multiple-groups Using multiple animable groups to improve performance

@ref AnimableGroup is optimized for case when no animation is running --- it
just puts itself to rest and waits until some animation changes its state to
@ref AnimationState::Running again. If you put animations which are not
permanently running into separate group, they will not be traversed every time
the @ref AnimableGroup::step() gets called, saving precious frame time.

@section SceneGraph-Animable-explicit-specializations Explicit template specializations

The following specializations are explicitly compiled into @ref SceneGraph
library. For other specializations (e.g. using @ref Magnum::Double "Double"
type) you have to use @ref Animable.hpp implementation file to avoid linker
errors. See also @ref compilation-speedup-hpp for more information.
