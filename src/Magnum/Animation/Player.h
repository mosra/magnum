/**
@brief Animation player
@tparam T   Time type
@tparam K   Key type

Provides a generic way for querying interpolated results from multiple
animation tracks of distinct types from a single place, together with managing
the animation running state.

Similarly to @ref Track / @ref TrackView, the player is also partially statless
--- in particular, it neither accesses any global timer or keeps any notion of
"current time". Instead, all time-dependent functions take absolute time as a
parameter. This both simplifies the internal state management and adds
additional flexibility on user side.

@section Animation-Player-setup Setting up

The @ref Player class is used by adding tracks to it and specifying what should
be done with interpolation result values. The simplest option is specifying a
destination location when adding the track using @ref add() --- that'll mean
you get a fresh set of animated values at your disposal after every iteration:

@snippet MagnumAnimation.cpp Player-usage

The Player stores just @ref TrackView instances, for every @ref Track instance
you have to ensure that it stays alive for the whole lifetime of the player
instance.

In case you need to apply the animated values using a setter, it's possible
to fire a callback every iteration. Note that the @ref addWithCallback()
function has also a typeless version taking just @cpp void* @ce user pointer
instead of a reference to a concrete type. Below is an example of animating
@ref SceneGraph object transformations using the
@ref SceneGraph::TranslationRotationScalingTransformation3D transformation
implementation:

@snippet MagnumAnimation.cpp Player-usage-callback

The @ref addWithCallbackOnChange() variant will fire the callback only if the
interpolated value changes, which is useful for triggering other events. See
@ref Animation-Player-higher-order "below" for an example. Lastly, there is
@ref addRawCallback() that allows for greater control and further performance
optimizations. See its documentation for a usage example code snippet.

The animation is implicitly played only once, use @ref setPlayCount() to set a
number of repeats or make it repeat indefinitely. By default, the
@ref duration() of an animation is calculated implicitly from all added tracks.
You can use @ref setDuration() to specify a custom duration:

-   If it extends beyond the keyframe values, values of begin/end keyframes
    will be extrapolated according to @ref Extrapolation specified for every
    track.
-   If it will be shorter, only a slice of the animation will be played.
-   If duration size is empty (min and and max se to the same value) and
    @ref setPlayCount() is set to inifite, then the animator will indefinitely
    give out value from a key that's at the start of the duration. If play
    count is finite, the animation will get stopped right away.

@section Animation-Player-playback Animation playback

By default, the player is in a @ref State::Stopped state. Call @ref play() with
a time value denoting the moment at which the animation should start. After
that, the @ref advance() function is meant to be called every frame with
a current time value. As long as the animation is playing, the @ref advance()
function will update track result destination locations with interpolated
values and/or fire user-defined callbacks described above.

Once the animation playback is finished (exhausing the whole @ref duration() of
all @ref playCount() iterations), the @ref advance() will update the
destination locations and/or fire user-defined callbacks with values that
correspond to @ref duration() end time. This is guaranteed to be always the
case in order to correctly "park" the animations --- even if your app would
freeze for a while and @ref advance() would get called later, the result values
will never be calculated from a key value that's outside @ref duration().

Calling @ref stop() immediately transfers @ref state() to @ref State::Stopped
and the next @ref advance() iteration will give out interpolated values
corresponding to the begin time of @ref duration(), again to "park" the
animation back to its initial state. After that, no more updates are done until
the animation is started again. Compared to when the animation stops by itself,
this will park it at the beginning, not at the end.

Calling @ref pause() while the animation is running immediately transfers the
animation state to @ref State::Paused and the next @ref advance() iteration
will give out interpolated values corresponding to a time that was passed to
the @ref pause() function. After that, no more updates are done until the
animation is resumed again with @ref play(), stopped with @ref stop() or seeked
using @ref seekBy() / @ref seekTo().

Calling @ref seekBy() / @ref seekTo() while the animation is either playing or
pause will cause it to jump to specified time -- the next call to @ref advance()
will update the destination locations and/or fire user-defined callbacks with
new values, behaving as if the animation was played / paused with the seek
time.

The callbacks are only ever fired from within the @ref advance() function,
never from @ref pause(), @ref stop() or any other API.

For managing global application you can use @ref Timeline, @ref std::chrono
APIs or any other type that supports basic arithmetic. The time doesn't have to
be monotonic or have constant speed, but note that non-continuous and backward
time jumps may have worse performance than going monotonically forward. See
@ref Animation-Player-time-type "below" for more information about using
different time types.

@snippet MagnumAnimation.cpp Player-usage-playback

@section Animation-Player-time-type Using custom time/key types

In long-running apps it's not desirable to use @ref Magnum::Float "Float" for
global application time, since its precision will deteriorate over time. Even
after one hour the precision loss might start to get noticeable. To overcome
this problem, it's possible to specify a type for time values that's different
from type used for animation track keys. In contrast, using
@ref Magnum::Float "Float" for animation track key values is usually good
enough, as the tracks are never too long for this to become a problem --- and
if the tracks *are* long, you can always use a different key type for them as
well. A good choice is @ref std::chrono::nanoseconds as a time type and keeping
track key values as @ref Magnum::Float "Float" seconds:

@snippet MagnumAnimation.cpp Player-usage-chrono

While there's a builtin support for the above, you are free to use any other
type combination --- for that you need to provide a *scaler* function that will
take care of converting a time difference to play iteration index and key value
inside given iteration. The types should be implicitly constructible, and have
basic arithmetic and comparison operators. In order to reduce header size, the
@ref Player implementation is in a separate @ref Player.hpp file that you need
to include to get all needed template function definitions. See also
@ref compilation-speedup-hpp for more information.

@snippet MagnumAnimation-custom.cpp Player-usage-custom

@section Animation-Player-higher-order Higher-order players, animating time

Sometimes you might want to control multiple players at the same time or
animate player state. That's doable by creating specialized tracks that control
given player via a state change callback. By adding more tracks you can control
multiple players from a central location.

@snippet MagnumAnimation.cpp Player-higher-order

Besides state, you can also animate @ref setDuration() and @ref setPlayCount(),
but be aware that setting those while the animation is playing might cause
unwanted jumps and abrupt stops. Time is also completely in your control and
you can employ another @ref Player instance to speed it up or slow it down for
a particular animation:

@snippet MagnumAnimation.cpp Player-higher-order-animated-time

@section Animation-Player-explicit-specializations Explicit template specializations

The following specializations are explicitly compiled into the @ref Animation
library. For other specializations (e.g. using an integer key type) you have to
use the @ref Player.hpp implementation file to avoid linker errors. See also
@ref compilation-speedup-hpp for more information.

-   @ref Player "Player<std::chrono::nanoseconds, Float>"
