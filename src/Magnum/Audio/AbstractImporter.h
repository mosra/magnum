/**
@brief Base for audio importer plugins

Provides interface for importing various audio formats.

@section Audio-AbstractImporter-usage Usage

Importers are most commonly implemented as plugins. For example, loading an
audio track from the filesystem using the @ref AnyAudioImporter plugin can be
done like this, completely with all error handling:

@snippet MagnumAudio.cpp AbstractImporter-usage

See @ref plugins for more information about general plugin usage and
`*Importer` classes in the @ref Audio namespace for available importer plugins.

@subsection Audio-AbstractImporter-usage-callbacks Loading data from memory, using file callbacks

Besides loading data directly from the filesystem using @ref openFile() like
shown above, it's possible to use @ref openData() to import data from memory.
Note that the particular importer implementation must support
@ref Feature::OpenData for this method to work.

Some audio formats sometimes reference other files (such as songs of a
playlist) and in that case you may want to intercept those references and load
them in a custom way as well. For importers that advertise support for this
with @ref Feature::FileCallback this is done by specifying a file loading
callback using @ref setFileCallback(). The callback gets a filename,
@ref InputFileCallbackPolicy and an user pointer as parameters; returns a
non-owning view on the loaded data or a
@ref Corrade::Containers::NullOpt "Containers::NullOpt" to indicate the file
loading failed. For example, loading a scene from memory-mapped files could
look like below. Note that the file loading callback affects @ref openFile() as
well --- you don't have to load the top-level file manually and pass it to
@ref openData(), any importer supporting the callback feature handles that
correctly.

@snippet MagnumAudio.cpp AbstractImporter-usage-callbacks

For importers that don't support @ref Feature::FileCallback directly, the base
@ref openFile() implementation will use the file callback to pass the loaded
data through to @ref openData(), in case the importer supports at least
@ref Feature::OpenData. If the importer supports neither @ref Feature::FileCallback
nor @ref Feature::OpenData, @ref setFileCallback() doesn't allow the callbacks
to be set.

The input file callback signature is the same for @ref Audio::AbstractImporter,
@ref Trade::AbstractImporter and @ref Text::AbstractFont to allow code reuse.

@section Audio-AbstractImporter-subclassing Subclassing

Plugin implements function @ref doFeatures(), @ref doIsOpened(), one of or both
@ref doOpenData() and @ref doOpenFile() functions, function @ref doClose() and
data access functions @ref doFormat(), @ref doFrequency() and @ref doData().

You don't need to do most of the redundant sanity checks, these things are
checked by the implementation:

-   Functions @ref doOpenData() and @ref doOpenFile() are called after the
    previous file was closed, function @ref doClose() is called only if there
    is any file opened.
-   Function @ref doOpenData() is called only if @ref Feature::OpenData is
    supported.
-   All `do*()` implementations working on opened file are called only if
    there is any file opened.

@attention @ref Corrade::Containers::Array instances returned from the plugin
    should *not* use anything else than the default deleter, otherwise this can
    cause dangling function pointer call on array destruction if the plugin
    gets unloaded before the array is destroyed.

         * empty files might also be valid in some circumstances, @cpp nullptr @ce
         * can't be used to indicate a failure.
         *
         * In case the importer doesn't support @ref Feature::FileCallback but
         * supports at least @ref Feature::OpenData, a file opened through
         * @ref openFile() will be internally loaded through the provided

         * the callback, then the returned memory view is passed to
         * @ref openData() (sidestepping the potential @ref openFile()
         * implementation of that particular importer) and after that the
         * callback is called again with @ref InputFileCallbackPolicy::Close
         * because the semantics of @ref openData() don't require the data to
         * be alive after. In case you need a different behavior, use
         * @ref openData() directly.
         *
         * In case @p callback is @cpp nullptr @ce, the current callback (if
         * any) is reset. This function expects that the importer supports
         * either @ref Feature::FileCallback or @ref Feature::OpenData. If an
         * importer supports neither, callbacks can't be used.
         *
         * It's expected that this function is called *before* a file is
         * opened. It's also expected that the loaded data are kept in scope
         * for as long as the importer needs them, based on the value of
         * @ref InputFileCallbackPolicy. Documentation of particular importers
         * provides more information about the expected callback behavior.

         * Following is an example of setting up a file loading callback for
         * fetching compiled-in resources from @ref Corrade::Utility::Resource.
