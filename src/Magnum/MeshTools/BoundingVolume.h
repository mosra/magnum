@m_since_latest

The resulting bounding sphere is not usually minimal. According to the author,
a 1% to 2% error can be expected. Due to the nature of the algorithm, the
radius is never below @ref Math::TypeTraits::epsilon(), even for empty or
entirely overlapping lists of points. <em>NaN</em>s are ignored, unless the
first position is <em>NaN</em> in which case it is propagated. Algorithm used:
