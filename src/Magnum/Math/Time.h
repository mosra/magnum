/**
@brief Nanoseconds
@m_since_latest

Along with @ref Seconds provides convenience classes to make time specification
and conversion less error-prone. As there's little need to represent fractions
of nanoseconds, the @ref Magnum::Nanoseconds typedef uses a 64-bit signed
integer, which covers a span of ±292 years. In scenarios where nanosecond
precision or a large range isn't needed, the @ref Magnum::Seconds typedef,
which is a 32-bit floating-point type, may be sufficient.

@section Math-Nanoseconds-usage Usage

You can create the value by using one of the time literals. For all of them the
result type is @ref Nanoseconds for preserving maximum precision, but you can
directly convert the literal value @link Seconds @endlink:

@snippet Math.cpp Nanoseconds-usage

Or by explicitly converting a unitless value (such as an output from some
function) to either nanoseconds or seconds. And same can be done in the other direction:

@snippet Math-stl.cpp Nanoseconds-usage-convert

The classes support all arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction
or multiplication/division by a unitless number:

@snippet Math.cpp Nanoseconds-usage-operations

It is also possible to compare time values with all comparison operators. As
the literals are all producing @ref Nanoseconds, it's most convenient to
compare to nanosecond values. Comparison of @ref Nanoseconds and @ref Seconds
is not possible without conversion to a common type first.

@snippet Math.cpp Nanoseconds-usage-comparison

@section Math-Nanoseconds-stl STL compatibility

Instances of @ref Nanoseconds are explicitly convertible from and to
@ref std::chrono::duration and @ref std::chrono::time_point types if you
include @ref Magnum/Math/TimeStl.h. The conversion is provided in a separate
header to avoid unconditional @cpp #include <chrono> @ce, which can
significantly affect compile times. The following table lists allowed
conversions, conversions in certain directions aren't allowed as they cause a
precision loss:

Magnum type      | ↭ | STL type
-----------------| - | ---------------------
@ref Nanoseconds | ⇆ | @ref std::chrono::nanoseconds
@ref Nanoseconds | ← | @ref std::chrono::microseconds
@ref Nanoseconds | ← | @ref std::chrono::milliseconds
@ref Nanoseconds | ← | @ref std::chrono::seconds
@ref Nanoseconds | ← | @ref std::chrono::minutes
@ref Nanoseconds | ← | @ref std::chrono::hours
@ref Nanoseconds | ← | @ref std::chrono::duration
@ref Nanoseconds | ⇆ | @ref std::chrono::duration "std::chrono::duration<Rep, std::nano>"
@ref Nanoseconds | ← | @ref std::chrono::time_point
@ref Nanoseconds | ⇆ | @ref std::chrono::time_point "std::chrono::time_point<Clock, std::chrono::duration<Rep, std::nano>>"

Example:

@snippet Math-stl.cpp Nanoseconds-usage

<b></b>

@m_class{m-block m-warning}

@par Conversion from and to std::time_t
    Even though @ref std::time_t may look like an implementation-defined strong
    type, it's actually just an alias to an integer type, which in turn means
    it's not possible to provide safe conversion for it. Thus a simple
    conversion, while it may compile, won't do the right thing:
@par
    @snippet Math-stl.cpp Nanoseconds-usage-time

    @link Literals::TimeLiterals::operator""_usec() @endlink,

/* Note on literal naming: while the STL in C++14 uses `ns`, `us`, `s` and
   https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/operator%22%22s claims that having
   `s` for both a string literal, taking const char*, and a second literal,
   taking long double, "just works", at least on GCC and Clang it's only true
   if both are defined next to each other IN THE SAME NAMESPACE. Which
   completely breaks any library composability or encapsulation, as it means I
   can not have a StringView _s literal defined in Corrade::Containers and a
   Nanosecond _s literal defined in Magnum::Math. The only workaround I found
   was to do something along the lines of the following, which was NOT NICE at
   all (and no, `using namespace Containers::Literals` wasn't enough).

    namespace Magnum { namespace Math { namespace Literals {
        using Containers::Literals::operator""_s;
    }}}

   Thus I'm choosing a different name to prevent the conflict from even
   happening. On the other hand, that's probably a better solution even without
   the above design issue in the C++ spec, because it prevents potential
   conflicts with _s / _us being eventually used for Short and UnsignedShort
   literals, or _h conflicting between half-float and hour literals (now it'd
   be _hr). Even C++14 picked `min` for minutes instead of `m` because it
   apparently seemed to become problematic once/if distance literals for meters
   and such get introduced. So why not go with the more clear name for
   everything already. Seeing 15.0_sec in unfamiliar code doesn't feel
   ambiguous, seeing 127_s or 0.5_h definitely does. */
