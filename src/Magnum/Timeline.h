/**
@brief Timeline

Keeps track of time delta between frames. Can be used as source for animation
speed computations.

@section Timeline-usage Basic usage

Construct the timeline on initialization so the instance is available for
whole lifetime of the application. Call @ref start() before first draw event is
performed, after everything is properly initialized.

@note When timeline is started, it immediately starts measuring frame time.
    Be prepared that time of first frame will be much longer than time of
    following frames. It mainly depends on where you called @ref start() in
    your initialization routine, but can be also affected by driver- and
    GPU-specific lazy texture binding, shader recompilations etc.

In your draw event implementation don't forget to call @ref nextFrame() after
buffer swap. You can use @ref previousFrameDuration() to compute animation
speed. To limit application framerate you can use
@ref Platform::Sdl2Application::setSwapInterval() "Platform::*Application::setSwapInterval()" or
@ref Platform::Sdl2Application::setMinimalLoopPeriod() "Platform::*Application::setMinimalLoopPeriod()".
Note that on @ref CORRADE_TARGET_EMSCRIPTEN "Emscripten" the framerate is
governed by browser and you can't do anything about it.

Example usage:

@code{.cpp}
MyApplication::MyApplication(const Arguments& arguments): Platform::Application{arguments} {
    // Initialization ...

    // Enable VSync or set minimal loop period for the application, if
    // needed/applicable ...

    timeline.start();
}

void MyApplication::drawEvent() {
    // Distance of object travelling at speed of 15 units per second
    Float distance = 15.0f*timeline.previousFrameDuration();

    // Move object, draw ...

    swapBuffers();
    redraw();
    timeline.nextFrame();
}
