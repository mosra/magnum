/**
@brief Create a signed distance field

Converts a binary black/white image (stored in the red channel of @p input) to
a signed distance field (stored in the red channel of @p output @p rectangle).
The purpose of this function is to convert a high-resolution binary image (such
as vector artwork or font glyphs) to a low-resolution grayscale image. The
image will then occupy much less memory and can be scaled without aliasing
issues. Additionally it provides foundation for features like outlining, glow
or drop shadow essentially for free.

You can also use the @ref magnum-distancefieldconverter "magnum-distancefieldconverter"
utility to do distance field conversion on command-line. This functionality is
also used inside the @ref magnum-fontconverter "magnum-fontconverter" utility.

@section TextureTools-DistanceField-algorithm The algorithm

For each pixel inside the @p output sub-rectangle the algorithm looks at
corresponding pixel in the input and tries to find nearest pixel of opposite
color in an area defined @p radius. Signed distance between the points is then
saved as value of given pixel in @p output. Value of 1.0 means that the pixel
was originally colored white and nearest black pixel is farther than @p radius,
value of 0.0 means that the pixel was originally black and nearest white pixel
is farther than @p radius. Values around 0.5 are around edges.

The resulting texture can be used with bilinear filtering. It can be converted
back to binary form in shader using e.g. GLSL @glsl smoothstep() @ce function
with step around 0.5 to create antialiased edges. Or you can exploit the
distance field features to create many other effects. See also
@ref Shaders::DistanceFieldVectorGL.

@attention This is a GPU-only implementation, so it expects an active GL
    context.

@note If internal format of @p output texture is not renderable, this function
    prints a message to error output and does nothing. On desktop OpenGL and
    OpenGL ES 3.0 it's common to render to @ref GL::TextureFormat::R8. On
    OpenGL ES 2.0 you can use @ref GL::TextureFormat::Red if
    @gl_extension{EXT,texture_rg} is available; if not, the smallest but still
    inefficient supported format is in most cases @ref GL::TextureFormat::RGB,
    rendering to @ref GL::TextureFormat::Luminance is not supported in most
    cases.

@note This function is available only if Magnum is compiled with
    @ref MAGNUM_TARGET_GL enabled (done by default). See @ref building-features
    for more information.
