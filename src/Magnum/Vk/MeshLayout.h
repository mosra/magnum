describing how vertex attributes are organized in buffers and what's the layout
of each attribute. Used as an input for creating a
@ref Vk-Pipeline-creation-rasterization "rasterization pipeline".

@section Vk-MeshLayout-usage Mesh layout setup

As an example let's assume a shader expects positions, texture coordinates and
normals in locations @cpp 0 @ce, @cpp 1 @ce and @cpp 5 @ce, respectively. If
we'd have them stored interleaved in a single buffer, the layout description
could look like this:

@snippet MagnumVk.cpp MeshLayout-usage

The `Binding` is then subsequently used as a binding index for a concrete
vertex buffer when drawing, which is described in the @ref Mesh class
documentation.

@subsection Vk-MeshLayout-usage-comparison Layout comparison

Because a @ref Pipeline is tied to a particular mesh layout (apart from certain
aspects that can be controlled via dynamic state), new pipelines should be
created only when the layout is actually different. For that, the class
provides a @ref operator==(), which returns @cpp true @ce when the two layouts
match.
