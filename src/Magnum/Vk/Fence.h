/**
@brief Fence
@m_since_latest

Wraps a @type_vk_keyword{Fence}, which is used for synchronizing the CPU to a
queue execution done on a Vulkan device.

@section Vk-Fence-creation Fence creation

A fence doesn't need any extra parameters for construction and can be
constructed directly using @ref Fence(Device&, const FenceCreateInfo&), leaving
the @p info parameter at its default. If you want to pass additional parameters
to it, include the @ref FenceCreateInfo class as usual:

@snippet MagnumVk.cpp Fence-creation

@section Vk-Fence-usage Basic usage

By default a fence is created unsignaled. It can be created in a signaled state
using @ref FenceCreateInfo::Flag::Signaled and its signaled state reset back
via @ref reset(). Fence status can be queried immediately via @ref status() and
waited on using @ref wait().

See @ref Vk-CommandBuffer-usage for an example usage in command buffer
submission.
