/**
@brief Device
@m_since_latest

Wraps a @type_vk_keyword{Device} and stores device-specific Vulkan function
pointers. A device provides an abstraction over a physical GPU or a CPU with
Vulkan capabilities.

@section Vk-Device-creation Device creation

With an @ref Instance ready, a device has to be picked first. Commonly it's
done by calling @ref pickDevice() and letting the library choose. This
selection is affected by the `--magnum-device`
@ref Vk-Device-command-line "command-line option", giving the end users an
ability to pick a particular device, choose a discrete or integrated GPU or
even a software implementation. If the application needs something specific,
you can use @ref enumerateDevices() instead, pick a device from the list
manually, provide the users with a list to choose from etc.

The picked device is then passed to @ref DeviceCreateInfo. At the very least
you'll also need to set up queues, as every Vulkan device needs at least one.
That's done by creating an empty @ref Queue instance and then referencing it
from @ref DeviceCreateInfo::addQueues(). After the device is constructed, the
queue gets populated and is ready to be used.

@snippet MagnumVk.cpp Device-creation-construct-queue

In the above snippet, we requested a graphics queue via a convenience API. The
information about available queues and other device properties is stored in a
@ref DeviceProperties that got returned from @ref pickDevice() and
@ref DeviceCreateInfo called @ref DeviceProperties::pickQueueFamily() for us.
As with device picking, you can also iterate through all
@ref DeviceProperties::queueFamilyCount() and choose one manually.

Same as with @ref Instance, the above won't enable any additional extensions
except for what the engine itself needs or what's supplied on the command line.
Use @ref DeviceCreateInfo::addEnabledExtensions() to enable them, you can use
both string names as well as predefined *device* extensions from the
@ref Extensions namespace. Later on, presence of predefined extensions can be
checked with @ref isExtensionEnabled().

@snippet MagnumVk.cpp Device-creation-extensions

In addition to extensions, you'll be usually enabling features as well. These
are all exposed in a giant @ref DeviceFeatures enum and you can simply OR them
together. Internally, those get translated to @type_vk{PhysicalDeviceFeatures2}
and related structures, features that are not exposed in the enum can be
enabled by adding a corresponding structure to the `pNext` chain. As with
extensions, the set of enabled features can be later checked with
@ref enabledFeatures().

@snippet MagnumVk.cpp Device-creation-features

However, usually you'll be checking for extension and feature availability
first, which is doable through
@ref DeviceProperties::enumerateExtensionProperties() and
@ref ExtensionProperties::isSupported() for extensions, and
@ref DeviceProperties::features() for features. In case of features you can
make use of the enum set operations and simply mask away features that are not
available --- however note that some features also require an extension to be
explicitly enabled.

@snippet MagnumVk.cpp Device-creation-check-supported

With both @ref Instance and @ref Device created, you can proceed to setting up
a @ref CommandPool and a @ref Pipeline, which will then need a
@ref ShaderSet and a @ref PipelineLayout. For rasterization pipelines, you'll
additionally need a @ref MeshLayout and a @ref RenderPass.

@subsection Vk-Device-portability-subset Vulkan portability subset

To simplify porting to platforms with the Portability Subset, Magnum implicitly
enables the @vk_extension{KHR,portability_subset} extension on all devices that
advertise it, as required by the spec, so you don't need to handle that part.
This behavior can be disabled with
@ref DeviceCreateInfo::Flag::NoImplicitExtensions.

For portability-related @ref DeviceFeatures, on conformant Vulkan
implementations (which don't advertise @vk_extension{KHR,portability_subset})
these are all implicitly marked as supported in @ref DeviceProperties::features()
and then implicitly marked as enabled in @ref Device::enabledFeatures(),
independently of whether you enable them or not. On devices having only the
Portability Subset, the supported features are listed in
@ref DeviceProperties::features() but you're expected to manually enable them
on device creation --- that part is *not done implicitly* by the engine.

A workflow that supports both conformant and Portability Subset devices with a
single code path is outlined in the following snippet --- on device creation
you request features that you want (which is a no-op on conformant
implementations), and at runtime you query those features in appropriate cases
(which will be always @cpp true @ce on conformant implementations). As with
other features, all APIs that require a particular Portability Subset feature
are marked as such and also listed among others at @ref requires-vk-feature.

@snippet MagnumVk.cpp Device-creation-portability-subset

@see @ref vulkan-wrapping-optimizing-properties

@section Vk-Device-command-line Command-line options

The @ref Device inherits a subset of the
@ref Vk-Instance-command-line "Instance command-line options", in particular
the following. If the @ref Instance didn't get `argc` / `argv` passed, only the
environment variables are used.

-   `--magnum-disable-workarounds LIST` --- Vulkan driver workarounds to
    disable (see @ref vulkan-workarounds for detailed info) (environment:
    `MAGNUM_DISABLE_WORKAROUNDS`)
-   `--magnum-disable-extensions LIST` --- Vulkan instance or device extensions
    to disable, meaning @ref DeviceCreateInfo::addEnabledExtensions() will skip
    them (environment: `MAGNUM_DISABLE_EXTENSIONS`)
-   `--magnum-enable-extensions LIST` --- Vulkan device extensions to enable in
    addition to @ref DeviceCreateInfo defaults and what the application
    requests (environment: `MAGNUM_ENABLE_EXTENSIONS`)
-   `--magnum-vulkan-version X.Y` --- force @ref Device Vulkan version instead
    of using what the device reports as supported, affecting what entrypoints
    and extensions get used (environment: `MAGNUM_VULKAN_VERSION`)
-   `--magnum-log default|quiet|verbose` --- console logging (environment:
    `MAGNUM_LOG`) (default: `default`)
-   `--magnum-device ID|integrated|discrete|virtual|cpu` --- device ID or kind
    to pick in @ref pickDevice(); if a device is selected through
    @ref enumerateDevices() or any other way, this option has no effect
    (environment: `MAGNUM_DEVICE`)

@section Vk-Device-raw Interaction with raw Vulkan code

In addition to the common properties explained in @ref vulkan-wrapping-raw,
the @ref Device contains device-level Vulkan function pointers, accessible
through @ref operator->():

@snippet MagnumVk.cpp Device-function-pointers

These functions are by default not accessible globally (and neither there is a
global "current instance"), which is done in order to avoid multiple
independent instances affecting each other. Sometimes it is however desirable
to have global function pointers --- for example when a 3rd party code needs to
operate on the same instance, or when writing quick prototype code --- and then
it's possible to populate those using @ref populateGlobalFunctionPointers().
Compared to the above, the same custom code would then look like this:

@snippet MagnumVk.cpp Device-global-function-pointers

Similarly you can use @ref Instance::populateGlobalFunctionPointers() to
populate instance-level global function pointers.

@section Vk-Device-disabled-move Disabled move and delayed device creation

Due to the way @ref Queue instances are populated on device creation, and
for safety reasons as all device-dependent objects internally have to keep a
pointer to the originating @ref Device to access Vulkan function pointers, the
@ref Device class is not movable. This leads to a difference compared to other
Vulkan object wrappers, where you can use the @ref NoCreate tag to construct an
empty instance (for example as a class member) and do a delayed creation by
moving a new instance over the empty one. Here you have to use the
@ref create() function instead:

@snippet MagnumVk.cpp Device-delayed-creation

Similar case is with @ref wrap() --- instead of being @cpp static @ce, you have
to call it on a @ref Device(NoCreateT) "NoCreate"'d instance. The @ref Instance
class behaves equivalently.
