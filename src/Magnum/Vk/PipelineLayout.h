/**
@brief Pipeline layout
@m_since_latest

Wraps a @type_vk_keyword{PipelineLayout}. Specifies what descriptor set layouts
and push constants are used in a @ref Pipeline.

@section Vk-PipelineLayout-creation Pipeline layout creation

Except for the rare case when your shader doesn't have any bindings, in which
case a default-constructed @ref PipelineLayoutCreateInfo would be enough,
you'll want to list @ref DescriptorSetLayout instances for all descriptor sets
needed by shaders in the pipeline:

@snippet MagnumVk.cpp PipelineLayout-creation

@section Vk-PipelineLayout-usage Pipeline layout usage

Once created, the pipeline layout instance is used for @ref Pipeline creation
and for descriptor set binding. See the corresponding class documentation for
more information.
