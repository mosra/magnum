/**
@brief Device memory
@m_since_latest

Wraps a @type_vk_keyword{DeviceMemory} and handles its allocation and mapping.
Device memory is backing Vulkan buffers, images and other objects.

@section Vk-Memory-allocation Memory allocation

By default, the memory will get allocated for you during the creation of
@ref Buffer, @ref Image and other objects. In case you want to handle the
allocation yourself instead (which you indicate by passing the @ref NoAllocate
tag to constructors of these objects), it consists of these steps:

1.  Querying memory requirements of a particular object, for example using
    @ref Buffer::memoryRequirements() or @ref Image::memoryRequirements()
2.  Picking a memory type satisfying requirements of the object it's being
    allocated for (such as allowed memory types) and user requirements (whether
    it should be device-local, host-mappable etc.) using
    @ref DeviceProperties::pickMemory()
3.  Allocating a new @ref Memory or taking a (correctly aligned) sub-range of
    an existing allocation from given memory type
4.  Binding the memory (sub-range) to the object, using
    @ref Buffer::bindMemory(), @ref Image::bindMemory() and others

The following example allocates a single block memory for two buffers, one
containing vertex and the other index data:

@snippet MagnumVk.cpp Memory-allocation

@section Vk-Memory-mapping Memory mapping

If the memory is created with the @ref MemoryFlag::HostVisible flag, it can be
mapped on the host via @ref map(). The unmapping is then taken care of by a
custom deleter in the returned @ref Corrade::Containers::Array. It's possible
to map either the whole range or a sub-range, however note that one @ref Memory
object can't be mapped twice at the same time --- in the code snippet above, it
means that in order to upload vertex and index data, there are two options:

-   One is to first map the vertex buffer sub-range, upload the data, unmap it,
    and then do the same process for the index buffer sub-range. This way is
    more encapsulated without having to worry if there's already a mapping and
    who owns it, but means more work for the driver.
-   Another option is to map the whole memory at once and then upload data of
    particular buffers to correct subranges. Here the mapping has to be owned
    by some external entity which ensures it's valid for as long as any buffer
    wants to map its memory sub-range.

The following example maps the memory allocated above and copies index and
vertex data to it:

@snippet MagnumVk.cpp Memory-mapping

<b></b>

@m_class{m-note m-success}

@par Map temporarily or forever?
    Mapping smaller ranges and unmapping again after makes sense on 32-bit
    systems where the amount of virtual memory is limited --- otherwise it may
    happen that the system won't be able to find a sufficiently large block of
    virtual memory, causing the next mapping to fail. On 64-bit systems the
    virtual address space is sufficiently large for most use cases and it's
    common to just map the whole memory block for its whole lifetime.
