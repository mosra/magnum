@brief Any audio importer plugin

@m_keywords{AnyAudioImporter}

Detects file type based on file extension, loads corresponding plugin and then
tries to open the file with it. Supported formats:

-   AAC (`*.aac`), loaded with any plugin that provides `AacAudioImporter`
-   MP3 (`*.mp3`), loaded with any plugin that provides `Mp3AudioImporter`
-   OGG Vorbis (`*.ogg`), loaded with any plugin that provides
    `VorbisAudioImporter`
-   WAV (`*.wav`), loaded with @ref WavImporter "WavAudioImporter" or any other
    plugin that provides it
-   FLAC (`*.flac`), loaded with any plugin that provides `FlacAudioImporter`

Only loading from files is supported.

@section Audio-AnyImporter-usage Usage

This plugin depends on the @ref Audio library and is built if
`WITH_ANYAUDIOIMPORTER` is enabled when building Magnum. To use as a dynamic
plugin, load @cpp "AnyAudioImporter" @ce via
@ref Corrade::PluginManager::Manager.

Additionally, if you're using Magnum as a CMake subproject, do the following:

@code{.cmake}
set(WITH_ANYAUDIOIMPORTER ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(magnum EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

# So the dynamically loaded plugin gets built implicitly
add_dependencies(your-app Magnum::AnyAudioImporter)
@endcode

To use as a static plugin or as a dependency of another plugin with CMake, you
need to request the `AnyAudioImporter` component of the `Magnum` package and
link to the `Magnum::AnyAudioImporter` target:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(Magnum REQUIRED AnyAudioImporter)

# ...
target_link_libraries(your-app PRIVATE Magnum::AnyAudioImporter)
@endcode

See @ref building, @ref cmake and @ref plugins for more information.

@section Audio-AnyImporter-proxy Interface proxying and option propagation

On a call to @ref openFile(), a file format is detected from the extension and
a corresponding plugin is loaded. After that, options set through
@ref configuration() are propagated to the concrete implementation, with a
warning emitted in case given option is not present in the default
configuration of the target plugin.

Calls to the @ref format(), @ref frequency() and @ref data() functions are then
proxied to the concrete implementation. The @ref close() function closes and
discards the internally instantiated plugin; @ref isOpened() works as usual.
