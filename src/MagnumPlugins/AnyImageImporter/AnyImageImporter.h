@brief Any image importer plugin

Detects file type based on file extension, loads corresponding plugin and then
tries to open the file with it. Supported formats:

-   Basis Universal (`*.basis` or data with corresponding signature), loaded
    with @ref BasisImporter or any other plugin that provides it
-   Windows Bitmap (`*.bmp` or data with corresponding signature), loaded with
    any plugin that provides `BmpImporter`
-   DirectDraw Surface (`*.dds` or data with corresponding signature), loaded
    with @ref DdsImporter or any other plugin that provides it
-   Graphics Interchange Format (`*.gif`), loaded with any plugin that provides
    `GifImporter`
-   OpenEXR (`*.exr` or data with corresponding signature), loaded with any
    plugin that provides `OpenExrImporter`
-   Radiance HDR (`*.hdr` or data with corresponding signature), loaded with
    any plugin that provides `HdrImporter`
-   Windows icon/cursor (`*.ico`, `*.cur`), loaded with @ref IcoImporter or any
    other plugin that provides it
-   JPEG (`*.jpg`, `*.jpe`, `*.jpeg` or data with corresponding signature),
    loaded with @ref JpegImporter or any other plugin that provides it
-   JPEG 2000 (`*.jp2`), loaded with any plugin that provides
    `Jpeg2000Importer`
-   Multiple-image Network Graphics (`*.mng`), loaded with any plugin that
    provides `MngImporter`
-   Portable Bitmap (`*.pbm`), loaded with any plugin that provides `PbmImporter`
-   ZSoft PCX (`*.pcx`), loaded with any plugin that provides `PcxImporter`
-   Portable Graymap (`*.pgm`), loaded with any plugin that provides
    `PgmImporter`
-   Softimage PIC (`*.pic`), loaded with any plugin that provides `PicImporter`
-   Portable Anymap (`*.pnm`), loaded with any plugin that provides
    `PnmImporter`
-   Portable Network Graphics (`*.png` or data with corresponding signature),
    loaded with @ref PngImporter or any other plugin that provides it
-   Portable Pixmap (`*.ppm`), loaded with any plugin that provides `PpmImporter`
-   Adobe Photoshop (`*.psd`), loaded with any plugin that provides `PsdImporter`
-   Silicon Graphics (`*.sgi`, `*.bw`, `*.rgb`, `*.rgba`), loaded with any
    plugin that provides `SgiImporter`
-   Tagged Image File Format (`*.tif`, `*.tiff` or data with corresponding
    signature), loaded with any plugin that provides `TiffImporter`
-   Truevision TGA (`*.tga`, `*.vda`, `*.icb`, `*.vst` or data with
    corresponding signature), loaded with @ref TgaImporter or any other plugin
    that provides it

Detecting file type through @ref openData() is supported only for a subset of
formats that are marked as such in the list above.

@section Trade-AnyImageImporter-usage Usage

This plugin depends on the @ref Trade library and is built if
`WITH_ANYIMAGEIMPORTER` is enabled when building Magnum. To use as a dynamic
plugin, load @cpp "AnyImageImporter" @ce via
@ref Corrade::PluginManager::Manager.

Additionally, if you're using Magnum as a CMake subproject, do the following:

@code{.cmake}
set(WITH_ANYIMAGEIMPORTER ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(magnum EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

# So the dynamically loaded plugin gets built implicitly
add_dependencies(your-app Magnum::AnyImageImporter)
@endcode

To use as a static plugin or as a dependency of another plugin with CMake, you
need to request the `AnyImageImporter` component of the `Magnum` package and
link to the `Magnum::AnyImageImporter` target:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(Magnum REQUIRED AnyImageImporter)

# ...
target_link_libraries(your-app PRIVATE Magnum::AnyImageImporter)
@endcode

See @ref building, @ref cmake, @ref plugins and @ref file-formats for more
information.

@section Audio-AnyImageImporter-proxy Interface proxying and option propagation

On a call to @ref openFile() / @ref openData(), a file format is detected from
the extension / file signature and a corresponding plugin is loaded. After
that, flags set via @ref setFlags() and options set through
@ref configuration() are propagated to the concrete implementation, with a
warning emitted in case given option is not present in the default
configuration of the target plugin.

Calls to the @ref image2DCount(), @ref image2DLevelCount() and @ref image2D()
functions are then proxied to the concrete implementation. The @ref close()
function closes and discards the internally instantiated plugin;
@ref isOpened() works as usual.
