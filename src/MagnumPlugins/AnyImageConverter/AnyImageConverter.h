@brief Any image converter plugin

Detects file type based on file extension, loads corresponding plugin and then
tries to convert the file with it. Supported formats for uncompressed data:

-   Basis Universal (`*.basis`), converted with @ref BasisImageConverter or any
    other plugin that provides it
-   Windows Bitmap (`*.bmp`), converted with any plugin that provides
    `BmpImageConverter`
-   OpenEXR (`*.exr`), converted with any plugin that provides
    `OpenExrImageConverter`
-   Radiance HDR (`*.hdr`), converted with any plugin that provides
    `HdrImageConverter`
-   JPEG (`*.jpg`, `*.jpe`, `*.jpeg`), converted with @ref JpegImageConverter
    or any other plugin that provides it
-   Portable Network Graphics (`*.png`), converted with @ref PngImageConverter
    or any other plugin that provides it
-   Truevision TGA (`*.tga`, `*.vda`, `*.icb`, `*.vst`), converted with
    @ref TgaImageConverter or any other plugin that provides it

No supported formats for compressed data yet. Only exporting to files is
supported.

@section Trade-AnyImageConverter-usage Usage

This plugin depends on the @ref Trade library and is built if
`WITH_ANYIMAGECONVERTER` is enabled when building Magnum. To use as a dynamic
plugin, load @cpp "AnyImageConverter" @ce via
@ref Corrade::PluginManager::Manager.

Additionally, if you're using Magnum as a CMake subproject, do the following:

@code{.cmake}
set(WITH_ANYIMAGECONVERTER ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(magnum EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

# So the dynamically loaded plugin gets built implicitly
add_dependencies(your-app Magnum::AnyImageConverter)
@endcode

To use as a static plugin or as a dependency of another plugin with CMake, you
need to request the `AnyImageConverter` component of the `Magnum` package and
link to the `Magnum::AnyImageConverter` target:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(Magnum REQUIRED AnyImageConverter)

# ...
target_link_libraries(your-app PRIVATE Magnum::AnyImageConverter)
@endcode

See @ref building, @ref cmake, @ref plugins and @ref file-formats for more
information.

@section Trade-AnyImageConverter-proxy Interface proxying and option propagation

On a call to @ref convertToFile(), a target file format is detected from the
extension and a corresponding plugin is loaded. After that, flags set via
@ref setFlags() and options set through @ref configuration() are propagated to
the concrete implementation, with a warning emitted in case given option is not
present in the default configuration of the target plugin.

The output of the @ref convertToFile() function called on the concrete
implementation is then proxied back.
