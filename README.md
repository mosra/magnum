Magnum — *Lightweight and modular C++11/C++14 graphics middleware for games and data visualization*

Looking for an open-source library that gives you graphics abstraction and
platform independence on major desktop, mobile and web platforms? Do you want
it to have all the convenience utilities around yet stay small, powerful and
not give up on flexibility? *Here it is.* And it's free to use, even for
commercial purposes.

Beauty of simplicity
====================

Among Magnum essentials is a UTF-8-aware OS, filesystem and console
abstraction, a feature-packed vector math library and a slim C++11 wrapper of
OpenGL / WebGL family of APIs. Build on top of that or opt-in for more.

[See all core features](https://magnum.graphics/features/)

With batteries included
=======================

Shaders and primitives for fast prototyping, algorithms, debugging and
automatic testing, asset management, integration with popular windowing
toolkits and a UI library. Everything fits together but you still have a
choice.

[List the extra features](https://magnum.graphics/features/extras/)

Screws are not glued in
=======================

There's always more than one way to do things. Enjoy the freedom of choice and
integrate your own asset loader, texture compressor, font format or math
library, if you feel the need. Or use any of the various plugins.

page in the documentation.

GETTING STARTED
===============

The best way to get started is to read the thorough
[download, build, install and start using Magnum](https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/getting-started.html)
in your project. There is also a completed
[building documentation](https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/building.html) — we
provide packages for many platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. After
that, there are various [tutorials and examples](https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/example-index.html)
and a complete [feature guide](https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/features.html)
explaining all aspects of the library.

Apart from that, various Magnum functionality is available through
[single-header libraries](https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/singles.html).
Just download a file, `#include` it in your project and you're ready to go! No
buildsystem wrangling is needed.

RELATED PROJECTS
================

The engine itself is kept as small as possible with only a few dependencies.
Additional functionality, often depending on external libraries, is provided in
separate repositories.

-   **Corrade** — main Magnum dependency, a multiplatform utility library:
    https://github.com/mosra/corrade
-   **Magnum Bootstrap** — bootstrap projects for many use cases, helping you
    get up and running in no time: https://github.com/mosra/magnum-bootstrap
-   **Magnum Plugins** — various importer plugins for image, font, audio and
    3D model formats are at https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins
-   **Magnum Integration** — integration with various external math and
    physics, get it at https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration
-   **Magnum Examples** — examples of engine usage, varying from simple
    *Hello World*-like example to more advanced applications, such as viewer
    for complex 3D models. See it at https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples
-   **Magnum Extras** — playground for testing new APIs, specialized stuff
    that doesn't necessarily need to be a part of main Magnum repository or
    mutually exclusive functionality: https://github.com/mosra/magnum-extras
-   **Magnum Bindings** — bindings to other languages such as Python are at
    https://github.com/mosra/magnum-bindings
-   **Magnum Singles** — various functionality from Magnum available as
    easy-to-integrate fast-to-compile single-header libraries:
    https://github.com/mosra/magnum-singles

Outside of the project itself, there's also a lot of community contributions
— [check them out on the website](https://magnum.graphics/features/community/).
